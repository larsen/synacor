# Synacor challenge 

The [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/) was presented
at OSCON and php[tek] in the past.

> In this challenge, your job is to use this architecture spec to create a

> you will find codes; submit these to the challenge website to track
> your progress.  Good luck!

I extended a bit the scope of the project: I decided to also write a
monitor/debugger for the virtual machine.  It seemed very useful to
solve the challenge, plus I've never written a QT GUI app in Common
Lisp, so this was a perfect excuse.
